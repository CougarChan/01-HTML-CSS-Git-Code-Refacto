01-HTML-CSS-Git-Code-Refactor This contains the correct refactor code of the Horiseon website. It has been looked at and fixed so it can provide a better experience for all users and can be used for long term use.  This has met all of the following criteria and I believe that the marketing agency will be satisified with all the changes that have been made to the code.  Changes that have been made  Developers will be able to find semantic HTML elements, elements will be able to find a logical structure, alt attributes will be accessible and easy to follow. You will be able to find this version more user friendly with links actually working and providing a pleasant experience.
